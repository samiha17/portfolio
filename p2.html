								<h2> Project</h2>
								<p>A Day in the Life is a web-based interactive novel that revolves
								around the perspective of four different people's experience of a seemingly
								ordinary day. &ensp;
								 <a href="https://misaellh.github.io/InteractiveNarrative/index.html">Link</a>
							 </p> 

							 <h2> Context</h2>
                                <p> 
								 This was my semester capstone group project for Creative Computing of Spring 2021. 
								 The storyline of this narrative was created based on the semester's theme: Together Apart/Time Space.
								 Indirect parallel connections were created in the storylines to emphasize the central ideas of the theme 
								 in a creative context. The overarching storyline and individual perspectives were all thoughtfully crafted 
								 in order to create a cohesive yet intriguing narrative.
								</p>

							<h2>Design Process</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/characters.png" /></span>
							<p><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> 
							All the characters in the story were thoughtfully developed from the selection of their names to their personalities and context of their world.
						</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/script.png" /></span>
							<p><strong>Writing:</strong> 
								A major part of the web-based novel was the writing process, and that took a lot of detail, creativity, and imagination to produce. 
								A snippet of each perspective of the manuscript can be seen above. 
								</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/low.png" /></span>
							<p><strong>Storyboarding:</strong> 
								Once the scripts were finalized, low-fidelty storyboards were developed for every scenario
								in each perspectives. </p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/adrian.png" /></span>
						<p><strong>Sketching:</strong> 
								Through iterative sketching, high quality illustrations were developed.
								Using Adobe Photoshop, novel and original artwork were produced
								that vividly illustrated the storyline. 
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wireframes.png" /></span>
							<p><strong>Wireframing:</strong> 
								We used Figma to create wireframes of how we wanted the images and texts to be placed on the website.
								Visualizing the placements of the texts and images lead to more iterative ideas on the layout.
								To create a more immersive experience the final layout of the webpages were changed so that the images were shown full screen.
								Text boxes were also added to increase readability.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/final.png" /></span>
							<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> 
								Sample webpages of the final layout can be seen above.  
								JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used to build the webiste.   
								The website technologicallys support all of the artistic creations (images and texts) with no lags and glitches. 
								Heuristic evaluations were conducted and found to uphold majority of usability principles.
