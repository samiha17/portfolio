                                <h2> Project</h2>
                                   <p>Hokie Accommodation Portal System (HAPS) is a web application that is
                                    intended to replace the current process of arranging alternate exam times for students
                                    with learning disabilities at Virginia Tech. &ensp;
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKlLE8V0Jk0&t=1s">Demo</a>
                                </p> 
                                <h2> Context</h2>
                                <p> The Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office
                                    serves more than two thousand students in Virginia Tech, 
                                    providing various accommodations and services for students with learning disabilities.
                                    One accommodation that we identified to be commonly used are timed test extensions. 
                                    The current process of arranging alternate exam times requires multi-communication between 
                                    students, teachers, and the SSD office. This communication is usually done through emails
                                    or in person. From our interviews and research we found that this process lacks structure 
                                    and often leads to points of confusion and frustration. Therfore the purpose of HAPS is to 
                                    streamline the current process of arranging alternate exam times with the SSD office into an
                                    online scheduling system.The overall goal was to create a simple and direct communication line 
                                    between all parties involved in arranging alternate exam times at Virginia Tech.  </p>
                                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                                <h3> Analyze &ensp; Design &ensp; Prototype &ensp; Evaluate</h3>
                                <p> We followed the user-centered design process to determine how students
                                    with disabilities may want to improve their experience arranging alternate 
                                    exam times based on observations and interviews.</p>

                                  <p> <strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Letting user research be our guide,
                                    we extracted and grouped interviews and observations into an Affinity Diagram. We then analyzed 
                                    our findings and identified interaction design requirements.</p>

                                        Using all of the fleshed out ideas from the ideation and creation process, 
                                        critique phase and mental models, we developed storyboards 
                                        to showcase our application design and system.
                                        </p>

                                      <p> <strong>Wireframing:</strong> We developed our wireframes in tandem with 
                                        our storyboards to ensure continuity and improvement of user experience.
                                        We went through several iterations between the wireframes and storyboards
                                        until we achieved a model that we believed users would easily be able to use.

                                            <strong>Prototyping:</strong>
                                            We began our prototype phase by developing key questions that we had based 
                                            on the previous two phases and the purpose of the application. The questions outlined
                                            what we wanted our prototype to accomplish, including: achieving the intended purpose, 
                                            appealing to both of our user bases, and being easy to use. In the end, we finalized four key questions:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li> Does our system do a good job of giving 
                                                    fair capabilities for all intended users? </li>
                                                <li> Does our application’s target users
                                                     have the skill set to navigate the application?</li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Does our application do justice in streamlining
                                                     the alternative testing process that is currently in place?
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Is our application’s creation of visual representations of 
                                                    communication appealing?
                                                </li>
                                            </ol>
                                            Based on our key questions, we chose to use a T type, click-through, medium-high fidelity prototype.

                                            This is intended to give a large, shallow look of all the features (Calendar, Direct Messenger, 
                                            User Profile, and Student Listings), but in particular, it would dive in deep to showcase our main feature: exam scheduler. 

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Evaluation Plan:</strong>
                                            For our UX Evaluation process, we determined that a mixture of the cognitive walkthrough approach and heuristic evaluation
                                            would be best for evaluating our system. Throughout the evaluation, we also used the think aloud protocol, asking the
                                            users to share their thought process while completing the task. 
                                            Our evaluation consisted of two members of our team conducting the evaluation with two expert participants.
                                            The procedure was conducted in two phases to evaluate our application’s student and faculty formats.
                                            The first phase was the evaluation of our student view of HAPS. The second phase was the evaluation of our professor view of HAPS.
                                            In both phases, we followed relatively the same process. We began by giving our experts a sheet with tasks to complete using our system, 
                                            such as “book this appointment” or “check this accommodation”. At the same time, we gave our experts a copy of Nielson’s Heuristics,
                                            and a heuristic violation form to fill out if any violations were discovered through the process of completing the aforementioned tasks.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Findings:</strong>
                                            Our evaluation went smoothly with only a few small issues with our prototype that were revealed through the evaluation. 
                                            The most common violation that was reported was “User control and freedom”, often in reference to small visual mistakes in our system 
                                            that need to be corrected to ensure users can operate the system with ease. One violation we took special notice of was a Consistency and Standards 
                                            violation which stated, “In user profile, accommodation history is not indicated as private, while the personal forms is.” 
                                            This was crucial to fix as user privacy is key in a confidential system such as HAPS.
                                            Some positive feedback was given in response to questions regarding the visual appeal and intuitiveness of the prototype design. 
                                        
                                        </p>
